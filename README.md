**Startup Project**


**Project Overview**
This project involves the development of a TypeScript system that models the operational structure of a startup facilitating citizens' access to state bonuses. It focuses on the interactions between startups, state incentives, and participating citizens.
Through the definition of interfaces and classes representing various system components (IStartup, IIncentivo, ICittadino), the project illustrates how technology can facilitate access to incentives and participation in sports activities.
The project includes both TypeScript source code and the compiled JavaScript file.
