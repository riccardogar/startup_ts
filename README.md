# Startup Project

## Project Overview

This project involves the development of a TypeScript system that models the operational structure of a startup facilitating citizens' access to state bonuses. It focuses on the interactions between startups, state incentives, and participating citizens. Through the definition of interfaces and classes representing various system components (`IStartup`, `IIncentivo`, `ICittadino`), the project illustrates how technology can facilitate access to incentives and participation in sports activities.

The project includes both TypeScript source code and the compiled JavaScript file.
